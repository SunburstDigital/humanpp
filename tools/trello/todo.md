<!--
  COLUMN: To Do
  FILE: todo.md
  PURPOSE: Mirrors the "To Do" column in Trello. All cards/issues from this column will appear here in strict project formatting.
  FORMATTING RULES:
    - Each card/issue must be boxed by START and END separators as shown in the README.
    - Card content must be kept between matching separators.
    - Never add blank lines inside a card block; always leave two blank lines between card blocks.
    - Card title and column name must match Trello exactly.
    - When moving cards between files, copy the entire block from START to END, inclusive.
  MAPPING:
    - Add both LIST_ID and FILE path to your .env file for scripts to auto-map.
      Example:
        LIST_ID_INPROGRESS=xxxxxxxxx
        FILE_INPROGRESS=in-progress.md
