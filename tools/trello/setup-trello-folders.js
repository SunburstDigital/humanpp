/**
 * Sunburst Digital AI â€” Trello Folder & File Setup Script
 *
 * - Creates the /tools/trello/ folder and an archive subfolder
 * - For each Trello column, creates a .md file with:
 *   - Page title matching the column
 *   - A comment block at the top specifying:
 *     - Column name (exactly as in Trello)
 *     - List ID (to be filled in by user)
 *     - Markdown file path (to be added in .env)
 *     - Description of purpose (mirrors Trello column)
 *     - Key formatting rules (as agreed)
 * - Creates README.md in /tools/trello/ with a full formatting example and usage instructions
 *
 * NOTE: When updating .env, always add both the LIST_ID and the corresponding markdown file path:
 *   LIST_ID_BACKLOG=xxxxxxxx
 *   FILE_BACKLOG=backlog.md

  PURPOSE: Mirrors the "${column}" column in Trello. All cards/issues from this column will appear here in strict project formatting.
  FORMATTING RULES:
    - Each card/issue must be boxed by START and END separators as shown in the README.
    - Card content must be kept between matching separators.
    - Never add blank lines inside a card block; always leave two blank lines between card blocks.
    - Card title and column name must match Trello exactly.
    - When moving cards between files, copy the entire block from START to END, inclusive.
  MAPPING:
    - Add both LIST_ID and FILE path to your .env file for scripts to auto-map.
      Example:
        LIST_ID_INPROGRESS=xxxxxxxxx
        FILE_INPROGRESS=in-progress.md
  -->\n\n# ${column}\n\n`;

  ARCHIVE: All completed/Done cards, full history.
  Cards moved here are not removed from Trello; this is a backup and audit record only.
  Follows exact card formatting as all project files.

  `# Sunburst Digital AI Trello Markdown Structure

This folder mirrors your Trello board columns for the Sunburst Digital AI project.  
Each file represents a Trello column and follows strict formatting for script and AI compatibility.

## Card Formatting Rules

- Every card/issue must be enclosed by matching START and END separator lines.
- Card content (description, checklist, comments) must be inside the block, with no extra blank lines inside.
- Always leave **two blank lines** between card blocks.
- Card titles and column names must match Trello exactly.
- When moving cards between files, copy the full block from START to END (inclusive).
- Each .md file begins with a comment block that matches its column and filename.
- Update your .env file for each Trello LIST_ID and corresponding markdown FILE.

## Example Card Block

${exampleBlock}


## .env Example

  LIST_ID_INPROGRESS=xxxxxxxxx
  FILE_INPROGRESS=in-progress.md


## Archive

- The archive/done-archive.md file stores full details for all completed cards.
- The done.md file contains only summary titles/dates for scan-ability.

// ðŸŸ© NOTES/INSTRUCTIONS FOR HUMANS & COPILOT:
//
// Run this script before the mirroring/sync script.
//
// When updating .env, always add both the Trello List ID and the Markdown file path:
//
// LIST_ID_BACKLOG=xxxxxxxx
// FILE_BACKLOG=backlog.md
//
// Each markdown file starts with a comment block explaining the mapping, formatting, and usage.
//
// See /tools/trello/README.md for the canonical formatting rules and a full card block example.
//
// Delay logic for sync scripts will be added later (e.g., using a debounce/timer before syncing updates).
