# Trello List Markdown Files

This folder contains one markdown file for each Trello board column, plus an archive subfolder.

- Each file is named `trello-<column>.md` and mirrors a single Trello column.
- Includes `trello-alerts.md` for system/critical/alert tasks.
- All card/task content for that column is stored here, following strict formatting rules (see the main README).
- The `archive/` subfolder contains `trello-done-archive.md` for completed cards.

Do not place JS scripts here. Only markdown files for columns and archive.

See the comment block at the top of each file for mapping and formatting details.
