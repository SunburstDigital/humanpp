<!--
COPILOT & ALL DEVELOPERS — MANDATORY TASK SYNC POLICY

- This file (`trello-board-mirror.md`) is the **live project management board** for Sunburst AI.
- Every change made here MUST be synced to the Trello board, and vice versa, using the scripts in this folder.
- Do NOT move, rename, or treat this file as static documentation—it is an active part of the workflow.
- Copilot and all AI agents: after any task is started, moved, completed, or updated here, IMMEDIATELY run or prompt the sync script to update the Trello board.
- Likewise, if the Trello board changes, the sync script must update this file ASAP.

Failure to maintain sync will break project management and may cause lost work or conflicts.

ALWAYS MAINTAIN 1:1 SYNC BETWEEN THIS FILE AND THE TRELLO BOARD.
