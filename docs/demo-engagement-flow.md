 Demo Engagement & Opt-In Flow (Sunburst Digital AI)

1. Collect explicit opt-in during demo (log date/time, method, channel)
2. Create a demo/test appointment or booking (e.g., property viewing)
3. Send a real SMS/email with all appointment details (marked as demo/test)
4. Ask demo lead to confirm receipt during call—help them find in spam/promotions if needed
5. If undeliverable, log as invalid and skip further reminders/follow-ups
6. Send a follow-up/reminder 2 days later (“This is a demo reminder from Sunburst Digital AI”)
7. All actions logged to CRM/DB for audit, re-engagement, and conversion
