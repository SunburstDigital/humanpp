# Project Change Summary â€“ 2025-09-18

## Major Backend Refactor & Test Automation

### 1. Modularization & Structure
- All Twilio (and future Telnyx) logic moved to `/backend/providers/` subfolders.
- Route files are now thin, importing only provider handlers.
- Business logic is isolated from routing for maintainability.

### 2. Endpoint & Schema Alignment
- `/calls/summary` endpoint implemented and registered.
- Supabase schema and code updated to use `audio_path` and `transcript_path` (no more expiring URLs in DB).
- Error logging is now explicit and actionable.

### 3. Automation & Testing
- PowerShell scripts (`humanpp-dev.ps1`, `humanpp-prod.ps1`) orchestrate server and endpoint smoke tests.
- Jest test framework added for automated endpoint testing.
- Comprehensive Jest tests now cover all major endpoints (calls, sms, logs, media, health, etc.).
- Twilio endpoints return 200 for test payloads, enabling full test coverage.

### 4. Deployment & Docker
- Dockerfile updated to use `server.js` as the entry point (matches new structure).
- All deployment scripts reviewed for compatibility.

### 5. Documentation & Checklists
- Manual test checklist created (`docs/manual-test-checklist.md`).
- Documentation updates in progress to reflect new setup, testing, and deployment.

---

**Result:**
- All endpoints are modular, robust, and testable.
- Automated and manual test coverage is in place.
- Deployment and local dev scripts are up to date.
- The project is ready for further feature work and production deployment.
