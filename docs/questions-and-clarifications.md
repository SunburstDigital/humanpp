# Sunburst Digital AI — Discussion & Open Questions Log

This page captures **all topics, edge cases, and “needs decision” points** as the project evolves.  
**How to use this file:**  
- Before starting a sprint or major build, review this log to see what decisions still need to be made.  
- As soon as a new question, edge case, or “let’s circle back” comes up (in chat, meeting, or demo), add it here.
- When a decision is made, note the answer, date, and (if relevant) reference the commit, doc, or SOP.

## 🔥 **Current Topics / Pending Decisions**

- [ ] What constitutes “consequence” (triggers escalation) for each industry/vertical?
- [ ] Best way to parse Handler email replies for FAQ auto-update? Manual review or AI summarization?
- [ ] Exact opt-in language and where to display/log it for demo, real leads, and website?
- [ ] Which client data should be pushed from Dux-Soup (LinkedIn) to CRM, and when?
- [ ] Should demo/test leads ever be deleted, or always converted to “real” for long-term remarketing?
- [ ] How will we version FAQ updates (for rollback/audit)?
- [ ] How often should we prompt Handler to update incomplete FAQ (daily, weekly, on threshold)?
- [ ] Minimum fields for “contact” record to enable omni-channel demo (name, email, phone, opt-in, source)?
